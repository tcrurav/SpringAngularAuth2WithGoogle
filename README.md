# Spring Boot + Angular Auth2 with Google

This example has been taken from the followin original tutorial:

[Creating Backend - Spring REST API - Part 1](https://www.javachinna.com/2020/10/23/spring-boot-angular-10-user-registration-oauth2-social-login-part-1/)

[Creating Backend - Spring REST API - Part 2](https://www.javachinna.com/2020/10/23/spring-boot-angular-10-user-registration-oauth2-social-login-part-2/)

[Creating Angular 10 Client Application - Part 3](https://www.javachinna.com/2020/10/28/spring-boot-angular-10-user-registration-oauth2-social-login-part-3/)

There are only some changes to correct some errors in the original project. That's all!

## Getting Started

It's important to create the Google Credentials in the Google developer console, and configure the Redirect Uri as shown in the following screenshot:

It's also important that you ENTER your Google Client Id and Google Client Secret in the application.properties file.

Finally create the database db_bicycles_oauth2

and in the Angular frontend just:

```
cd angular-11-social-login
npm install

ng serve --port 8081
```

Enjoy!!!
